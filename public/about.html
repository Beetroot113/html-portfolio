<h1>About me</h1>
<p>
 Iâ€™ve had the privilege of appearing for two SSB interviews â€” first at 21 SSB Bhopal (Indian Army) and later at 33 SSB Bhopal (Indian Navy), where I successfully cleared Stage 1(Screening) in both. These experiences taught me the true importance of discipline, leadership, and organizational ability in shaping oneâ€™s personality. ðŸ’¡ They not only challenged me but also enhanced my confidence and outlook.
</p>

<p>
 ðŸ’» Alongside this, I have a deep passion for technology. Iâ€™m currently learning C++ and Python, and the more I dive into tech, the stronger my fascination and drive to learn become.
</p>

<p>
 ðŸŽ¤ Beyond academics and interviews, Iâ€™ve been anchoring since class 6th, which has significantly boosted my communication and public speaking skills â€” qualities that complement both my technical and leadership journey.  
</p>

<p>
 ðŸŒŸ With a blend of discipline from SSB experiences, curiosity in tech, and strong communication skills, Iâ€™m eager to grow further and contribute meaningfully in the tech space!
